# ADR 2: Adoption of Backend Technologies for FlowQuest Application

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In the development phase of the "FlowQuest" application, we need to establish a robust backend technology stack that will enhance our development efficiency and ensure the smooth operation of our application.

## Decision Drivers
- Efficiency in development and deployment processes.
- Consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).
- Effective management and migration of the database schema.
- Scalability and maintainability of the application.

## Considered Options
- Use of Spring Boot as the application framework.
- Maven for dependency management and build automation.
- Docker for containerizing the database environment.
- Flyway for database migration management.

## Decision Outcome

### Use of Spring Boot
We have chosen **Spring Boot** for our application framework due to its ease of use, auto-configuration capabilities, and the comprehensive ecosystem it offers.

### Maven for Dependency Management
**Maven** will be our tool for dependency management and build automation. Its proven track record and widespread usage make it a reliable choice for our build processes.

### Docker for Database Containerization
**Docker** is selected to containerize our database environment. This choice ensures consistency across our development, testing, and production environments and simplifies configuration and scalability concerns.

### Flyway for Database Migration
We will use **Flyway** to manage our database migrations. Flyway provides a straightforward approach to version control for our database schema, making it easier to manage schema changes and migrations across environments.

## Rationale
The combination of Spring Boot, Maven, Docker, and Flyway offers a cohesive and efficient backend technology stack. Spring Boot simplifies development and enhances productivity, Maven provides dependable build and dependency management, Docker ensures environmental consistency, and Flyway offers robust database migration management.

## Implications
- The development team needs to be skilled or receive training in these technologies.
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines will be set up to integrate seamlessly with Maven and Docker.
- Regular database migration management and monitoring will be crucial to maintain the integrity and consistency of our database schema.
