# ADR 1: Use of SQL Database for FlowQuest Application Management

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The FlowQuest application requires a system for storing, retrieving, updating, and tracking the history of applications. We need a robust system capable of handling these requirements while providing scalability and reliability.

## Decision Drivers
- Data integrity and relational data modeling
- Transactional support for maintaining consistent state changes
- Complex query capabilities for filtering and pagination

## Considered Options
- SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)

## Decision Outcome
We have decided to use a **relational SQL database**. MySQL has been chosen as the specific implementation due to its widespread adoption, comprehensive feature set, and compatibility with our existing infrastructure.

## Rationale
The SQL database has been chosen for the following reasons:
- **Data Integrity**: Relational databases provide strong support for data integrity and relationships between tables.
- **Transactions**: The need for transactions is critical in ensuring data consistency during CRUD operations and state transitions.
- **Queries**: SQL offers rich querying capabilities that are essential for the application's filtering and pagination requirements.
- **Maturity**: SQL databases have a long history of development and are supported by a broad community.
