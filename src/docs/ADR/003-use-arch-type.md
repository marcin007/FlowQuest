# ADR 3: Choosing Architecture type for FlowQuest Application

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The "FlowQuest" application requires a robust and scalable architecture. We faced a decision on the architectural style that would best suit our development and operational goals.

## Decision Drivers
- Maintainability and scalability of the application.
- Ease of development and testing.
- Clarity in code organization and separation of concerns.

## Considered Options
- Layered architecture with Controller/Services/Repository (C/S/R) pattern.
- Hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters).
- Modular monolithic architecture.

## Decision Outcome

### Controller/Services/Repository Pattern
We have decided to adopt the **Controller/Services/Repository (C/S/R) pattern** for our application architecture. This decision was made based on the following considerations:

- **Controllers** will manage HTTP requests and responses, serving as the interface for client interactions.
- **Services** will encapsulate the business logic of the application, maintaining separation from the controllers and repositories.
- **Repositories** will handle data access and persistence, interacting with the database.

### Reasons for Not Choosing Alternative Options
While both hexagonal architecture and modular monolith were considered, we concluded that the C/S/R pattern offered the best balance of simplicity, maintainability, and clarity for our development team. The hexagonal architecture, though offering excellent isolation and testability, was deemed too complex for our current requirements. The modular monolith structure was appealing but not necessary given the scope and scale of our application.

## Rationale
The C/S/R pattern provides a clear separation of concerns, which simplifies maintenance and enhances testability. It offers a straightforward and well-understood structure that aligns with our team's expertise and the nature of our application. This pattern also allows for sufficient scalability and flexibility as the application evolves.

## Implications
- Development team members must have a clear understanding of their roles within each layer of the architecture.
- Adequate testing strategies, including unit and integration tests, need to be established for each layer.
- We must ensure that the separation of concerns is maintained as the application grows and evolves.
